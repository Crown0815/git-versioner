A tool to manage versions of git repositories using conventional commits and semantic versioning

Usage: git-versioner [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -p, --path <PATH>
          Path to the repository to calculate the version for

      --main-branch <MAIN_BRANCH>
          Regex to detect the main branch

      --release-branch <RELEASE_BRANCH>
          Regex to detect the release branch(es)

      --feature-branch <FEATURE_BRANCH>
          Regex to detect the feature branch(es)

      --tag-prefix <TAG_PREFIX>
          Regex to detect version tag(s)

      --pre-release-tag <PRE_RELEASE_TAG>
          Regex to detect pre-release version tag(s)

      --continuous-delivery
          Calculate version using continuous delivery mode

      --commit-message-incrementing <COMMIT_MESSAGE_INCREMENTING>
          Increment considering conventional commits (values: 'Disabled' (default) or 'Enabled'):
          - Disabled: Incrementation will be based on tags and release branches only.
                      After a release tag is created on the main branch (e.g. v1.2.0), the main branch will
                      automatically be bumped to the next minor version (e.g. v1.3.0).
          - Enabled:  Incrementation will be based on tags, release branches and commits.
                      Instead of bumping the minor version on the main branch after a feature release tag
                      (e.g. v1.2.0), only the patch version will be incremented (e.g. v1.2.1) until a `feat:`
                      commit is encountered or a release branch is created.

  -a, --as-release
          Forces release generation instead of pre-release

      --show-config
          Print effective configuration and exit

  -v, --verbose
          

  -c, --config <CONFIG_FILE>
          Path to a configuration file (TOML or YAML)

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
